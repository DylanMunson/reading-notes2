# Read 9: Forms and Events

## Forms

Forms are a very important thing in web development. The main idea of a form is you give it the information requested, then you press a button to submit it to the server. The most popular form is the google search box, which is a very prime example of when you would use a form in your website. Other than just enabling users to search, you'll see forms when shopping online, signing up for things or anywhere that you fill in information and the website performs a function with said information. Anywhere that a user would enter a password, username, fill in a text box, make choices such as selecting a checkbox, upload a file, or submit anyting, that would be a form. 

## Events

While on a web browser, it registers different type of events. Events are the browsers way of acknowledging something that is happening, and you can make your script respond to these said events. Events happen when a user clicks on a link, swiped past an element, types on the keyboard, almost anyhing. When an event happens, it can be used to trigger a function, and different code can be triggered when a user interacts with a different part of the page. There are UI events which occur when a user interacts with the UI rather than the web page. Keyboard events happen when a user interacts with the keyhoard, and mouse events interact with a mouse, trackpag, or touch screen.
