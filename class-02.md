## External CSS

In an HTML file, you can link an external CSS file for styling. To do this is very simple and there are 4 parts. The link element, the href which specifies the file path to the css file, the type which specfies the type of document being linked to, and rel which shows the relationship between the html page and the file.
The code would look like this "<link href="css/styles.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />"
