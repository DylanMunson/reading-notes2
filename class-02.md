## External CSS

In an HTML file, you can link an external CSS file for styling. To do this is very simple and there are 4 parts. The link element, the href which specifies the file path to the css file, the type which specfies the type of document being linked to, and rel which shows the relationship between the html page and the file.

## JS Comments

In your code, it is important to leave comments to let other poeple know what your code does. The way to leave comments in javascript is a little bit different, you open the comment with slash+star, and close it with star+slash. This is very useful for anyone who reads your code, including yourself because it lets you know what you were thinking and what your code does.
