# Reading: 08 - More CSS Layout

## Multiple Style Sheets

In your html, you can link more than one style sheet. To do so is quite simple, you just add another link to the file of said style sheet. As with all style sheets, if two rules apply to the same element, rules that appear later in a document will take precedence over the previous rules. This means whichever style sheet you link last in the flow, will have precedence over the ones above it. This feature could be useful if you want to separate your css more to make it less cluttered, or if it just applies to something seperate and it makes more sense for you to use another style sheet. 

## Fixed Width and Liquid Layouts

Fixed width layouts do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of the browser window and these measurements are given in pixels. This can be useful because pixel values are more accurate at controlling size and position, and it's easier to control the appearance compared to the liquid layout. Liquid layouts stretch and contract as the user changes the size of the browser window, which is useful for filling the enitre browser window and leaving no spaces around the page on larger screens. If you dont control the width of the sections, the design could come out looking a lot different than expected and that makes it a little bit more diccifult to control as opposed to the fixed width layouts.
