# Reading 05: HTML Images; CSS Color & Text

## Colors

In CSS, there are 2 different properties you can use to change colors, being the foreground color(text color), and the background color. For both of these properties, you can specify these colors using RGB values, hex codes, or one of the 147 predefined color names that are defined by browsers. Hex codes set colors by saying how much red, green, and blue is in a color and they look like this 'rgb(100,34,93)'. Hex Codes are 6 digit codes that represent how much red, green, and blue is in a color as well, and these codes are used following a pound sign. The final way to specify color is using the color names themselves, choosing out of th 147 predefined colors that browsers have. This method of specifying color is less commonly used as they are harder to remember and you have less control over the colors.

## Text

There are lots of different typefaces in text on a browser that are basically the style of font that you decide. *Serif* fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters, while *sans-serif* has straight ends of letters which makes it look cleaner. *Monospace* fonts make each letter have the exact same width, other fonts have different widths for each letter. This type of font is primarily used in coding because it aligns nicely and makes things look cleaner. *cursive* fonts either have joining stroked or other characteristics found in cursive. Comic sans is a prime example of this type of font. The last typeface is *fantasy* which is usually used for titles and not designed to be used in bodies of text. Browsers always have to have at least one typeface from each of these groups.
