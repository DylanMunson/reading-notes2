## Positioning

There are quite a few positioning schemes in HTML that can do big things on your site, one of them is fixed positioning. Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed. It positions the element in relation to the browser window, so when a user scrolls down the page, it stays in the exact same place. Another positioning scheme is Absolute positioning, which is when the position property is given a value of absolute and the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other things on the page, whichs means it acts like its not there.

## Functions

To create a funtion is very easy, you give it a name and write the statements needed in order to complete the tasts in the curly braces. You Declare it using the function keyword, followed by the function name and parenthesis. The statements to perform said task sit in the code block below it. To run this function, you can use the function name followed by perenthesis. This is known as **calling the function.** You can call a function as many times as you want within the same js file which is very handy for big projects. You can call the funtion before its been declared because the script is ran through first before it is executed.
