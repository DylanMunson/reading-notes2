## Positioning

There are quite a few positioning schemes in HTML that can do big things on your site, one of them is fixed positioning. Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed. It positions the element in relation to the browser window, so when a user scrolls down the page, it stays in the exact same place. Another positioning scheme is Absolute positioning, which is when the position property is given a value of absolute and the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other things on the page, whichs means it acts like its not there.
