## Switch Statements

Switch statements are very useful. You start off a switch statement with the switch value in the variable, followed by cases in the curly braces. In the cases are values of said variable, which indicate which case to execute. If the variable doesn't match any of the cases, it resorts to running the default case. At the end of each case is a *break* keyword which indicates that the specific switch statement (case) is finished and it can proceed to run the next bit of code. 'switch (level)'
