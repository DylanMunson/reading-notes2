## Switch Statements

Switch statements are very useful. You start off a switch statement with the switch value in the variable, followed by cases in the curly braces. In the cases are values of said variable, which indicate which case to execute. If the variable doesn't match any of the cases, it resorts to running the default case. At the end of each case is a *break* keyword which indicates that the specific switch statement (case) is finished and it can proceed to run the next bit of code. The Main idea of a switch statement is that a match is found, the code is run, then the break statement stops the rest of the switch statement from running.

## Overflowing Content

The overflow property in CSS is very handy for making your site clean. It tells the browser what to do if the content you're working with is larger than the provided space, and it can have one of 2 values. The first value of this CSS property is 'hidden', which says to hide any content that is overflowing. The second value is 'scroll' which adds a scrollbar to the space to enable you to scroll and see and missing content. This property is useful in situations where the user adjusts the text size through their browser to be larger or smaller, because you can hide any overflow from overlapping onto other content on the page.
